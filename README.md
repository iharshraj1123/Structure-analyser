#How to use
- Loads and Supports can only be added at nodes. So if you want to add a force somewhere make sure to add a node there.
- You cant make nodes randomly between an already defined/drawn member. Make nodes beforehand wherever its needed.

#Note
- Saving feature won't work without a HTTP server ie apache or node.js.
- The main file is index.html, open it in any modern browser.
- html file in dist is portable version (but its not always updated). The whole app is compiled into the structure analyser.html in dist.
