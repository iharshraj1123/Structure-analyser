## What is electron version?
- This repository features the web version of the app. Electron is PC app version for it.
- Electron version is bundle of everything in web version with chromium (thus larger download size).
- If you need saving feature and dont understand/want to setup a server, simply download the Electron version.

## How to use
- Loads and Supports can only be added at nodes. So if you want to add a force somewhere make sure to add a node there.
- You cant make nodes randomly between an already defined/drawn member. Make nodes beforehand wherever its needed.

## Note
- Saving feature won't work without a HTTP server i.e., apache or node.js. (It will work in the electron version).
- The main file is index.html, open it in any modern browser.
- html file in dist is portable version (but its not always updated). The whole app is compiled into the structure analyser.html in dist.
